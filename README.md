## IDENTITY PROTECTION

Elevate your cybersecurity strategy with Ironchip Identity Platform, designed to bring the power of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to your desktop computing environment. [Know more](https://www.ironchip.com/en/mobileless-authentication).

**Role-based privilege management:**
Set different user privileges. Prevents unauthorized users from accessing the rest of the system and misusing information, mitigating malicious users.

**Restrict access from unauthorized places:**
Generate enabled access from authorized areas and take your security to the next level.

**Supervision of accesses in real time:**
Check user activity, view access on a timeline, get reports and download them for full control.

**Intrusion detection system (IDS):**
Location-based reporting system to alert of sim swapping, phishing, device switching, etc.

## Logon

### What it is
Logon is a custom Windows credential provider designed by [Ironchip](https://www.ironchip.com/) to bring the power of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to your desktop computing environment.

**Cached Passwords:**
Our simplified access can enhance user experience, making it more convenient and user-friendly. This is especially valuable in a work or personal environment where you're required to log in to various systems multiple times a day.

**Extra Layer:**
MFA adds an extra layer of protection, requiring multiple forms of authentication, such as a password and a one-time code or push notification. 

**Improved Compliance:**
MFA helps organizations meet compliance requirements and security standards by implementing robust authentication methods.

### Logs

The Ironchip Credential Provider generates diagnostic and operational logs to help with monitoring and troubleshooting. These logs are written to the Windows Event Viewer under Applications and Services Logs â†’ [YourCompanyName] â†’ CredentialProvider.

To view the logs:
1) Open Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc).
2) Navigate to `Windows logs>Applications`.
3) Look for logs comming from `IronchipLogon` and `Ironchip OTP Service`

#### Changing the Log Level
The log verbosity can be configured through the providerâ€™s configuration registry `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{D2CBBFE7-22CC-4FF0-A7C4-8FCDCFB141B7}` you can modify the value of `logLevel` with the values:
 - `error` â€“ Logs only error events.
 - `warning` â€“ Logs warnings and errors.
 - `info` â€“ Logs general operational information, warnings, and errors.
 - `debug` â€“ Logs detailed diagnostic information. **Not recommended** for regular use, as it can quickly fill the Event Viewer due to the volume of data. Use this level only when lower levels do not provide sufficient details for troubleshooting.
